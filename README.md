Real-Time Face Recognition Attendance Tracking System
Project Overview
This project implements a real-time face recognition system designed for attendance tracking. It captures student images through a webcam, compares them against a database of stored images, and automatically marks attendance based on the recognized faces. The system integrates with Firebase for seamless storage and retrieval of student data and images.

Features
Real-Time Face Recognition: Uses a webcam to capture images and match them against the database.
Attendance Tracking: Automatically logs the attendance when a student's face is recognized.
Firebase Integration: Stores student data and images in Firebase for easy retrieval and management.
Automatic Enrollment: Adds new students to the database when they are first recognized.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface to view attendance records and manage student profiles.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for the face recognition and backend logic.
OpenCV: Library for real-time computer vision, used for capturing and processing video frames.
Firebase: Cloud service used for storing student images and attendance records.
Face Recognition Library: Python library used for recognizing and comparing faces.
